    "Today, Jupyter notebooks are used in data science, astronomy, biology, gene research, engineering, teaching, and more. A very interesting information on them was published some years ago in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1) and an introduction to Jupyter notebooks from one of its creators. Here is a lecture of [Fernando Per√©z](https://bids.berkeley.edu/events/project-jupyter-architecture-and-evolution-open-platform-modern-data-science) how Jupyter notebooks came into place and what is done with them in science. And for more enjoyment, here's a story on [notebooks](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/) in a wider context and why scientists became software developers and why notebooks are \"computational essays\".\n",
