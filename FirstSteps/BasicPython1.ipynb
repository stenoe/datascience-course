    "# Basic Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook basic Python language constructs are learned. Here, we will not introduce Python as a tool to program applications but as a programming tool for data science. We use it together with the Jupyter notebook environement and we will stay specific to this. General beginners tutorials can be found [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers). However, some basic contructs are introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data science viewpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we actually want? We want to be able to process data, be it from forestry data repositories, or other sources like the SMEAR stations network, the [ICOS Carbon Portal](https://www.icos-cp.eu), the [NOAA climate data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually we have some task or idea like how to compare the monthly average carbon dioxide concentration in forests. We would need to find the data, download them and load them into a Jupyter/Python notebook, transform them to the wanted structure (monthly averages of different years at different places), make some analyses (visual, statistical,...), produce meaningful output (graphs, tables,...) and save the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Jupyter notebooks let us further use the notebook document as computational document were we can add our thoughts and we can even use it to publish our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Python REPL\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok,what's that? First, programming languages can be interpreted or compiled. In simple words, the interpreted code is translated into machine code (what the computer actually understands) while the program or app is running and the compiled code is first translated into machine code and the executed. That means, again in simple words, interpreted code can be changed, re-executed and you get the result as a feedback immediately. In copiled code, you need first write it in some editor, compile it, execute it, if there is need for change (almost always there is) this cycle begins again (edit-compile-run).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the interpreter follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**R**ead \n",
    "\n",
    "**E**valuate\n",
    "\n",
    "**P**rint\n",
    "\n",
    "**L**oop\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the **REPL** acronym. It reads the code / number / string /..., then evaluates it, prints it to the \"console\" or in the Jupyter notebook into the output cell and finally loop this process and waits for the next input to be read. Some examples are:\n"
